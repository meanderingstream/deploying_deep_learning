# Deploying Deep Learning Models
---
* "Brilliant" Deep Learning Idea
* Built initial Model
> Minimum Viable Product
* What could go wrong
* Deployment Alternatives
* Choices
* Example Project

---
## We'll Focus on smaller scale project

* Websites
* Low-volume Services

> Higher-scale --> Resources to solve that challenge

## What could go wrong?

* Misidentification
* Linked to Bank Account
* Obtain some business value
* Security of application
---
## Model is just a function

> Inputs, Processing, Result

## Architectures for Function Calls

* Remote Procedure Calls
* SOAP requests
* JSON Service
* Web Socket Communication
* Serverless
---
## Why Distributed?

* Deep Neural Nets use lots of Memory
* Lots of simple math function calls
* Slows down your web server when scaling model calls
---
## To GPU or not to GPU?

* Latency impact on business
* Sustained concurrent usage

---
## Remote Function Calls
---
## Serverless

Productionizing Flask

[Find a recommendation]

---
## Remote communication via JSON

* Security
* Denial of Service Attack Robustness
* Direct Service Access by 3rd Party 
---
## Distributed Procedure Call
[Elixir Calling Python]
---
## Optimization

* Latency vs Accuracy
* Cost vs Accuracy at medium scale
---
## Distillation

- Train accurate, complex model

- Train a simpler model from complex model
